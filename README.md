>In the U.S., Section 103(f) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) [(17 USC ยง 1201 (f) - Reverse Engineering)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201) specifically states that it is legal to reverse engineer and circumvent the protection to achieve interoperability between computer programs (such as information transfer between applications). Interoperability is defined in paragraph 4 of Section 103(f).
>
>It is also often lawful to reverse-engineer an artifact or process as long as it is obtained legitimately. If the software is patented, it doesn't necessarily need to be reverse-engineered, as patents require a public disclosure of invention. It should be mentioned that, just because a piece of software is patented, that does not mean the entire thing is patented; there may be parts that remain undisclosed.


Puffco, I love your products, and I mean no harm in releasing this information. I only did this as a side project so I can control the peak pro however I want. I decided to publish my findings so that anyone else who is looking to do the same has a place to start. Long story short, __please don't sue me, or DMCA this repo__. If you wish for me to take it down, __please email me or leave a issue on this repo stating that you would like it to be removed, and I will happily do so__.

Now on to the documentation/writeup!
