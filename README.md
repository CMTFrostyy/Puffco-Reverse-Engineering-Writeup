A writeup on how I reversed engineered the puffco peak pro

# A Message to Puffco
>In the U.S., Section 103(f) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) [(17 USC ยง 1201 (f) - Reverse Engineering)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201) specifically states that it is legal to reverse engineer and circumvent the protection to achieve interoperability between computer programs (such as information transfer between applications). Interoperability is defined in paragraph 4 of Section 103(f).
>
>It is also often lawful to reverse-engineer an artifact or process as long as it is obtained legitimately. If the software is patented, it doesn't necessarily need to be reverse-engineered, as patents require a public disclosure of invention. It should be mentioned that, just because a piece of software is patented, that does not mean the entire thing is patented; there may be parts that remain undisclosed.


Puffco, I love your products, and I mean no harm in releasing this information. I only did this as a side project so I can control the peak pro however I want. I decided to publish my findings so that anyone else who is looking to do the same has a place to start. Long story short, __please don't sue me, or DMCA this repo__. If you wish for me to take it down, __please email me or leave a issue on this repo stating that you would like it to be removed, and I will happily do so__.

Now on to the documentation/writeup!
# My Findings
### Checklist of things I've accomplished.
- [x] Change lantern Colour.
- [x] Change profiles (1-4) Colour, temperature, time.
- [x] Set profile colour to any sort of animation.
- [x] Set base, logo, main, glass LED brightness.
- [x] Data not shown in the app.
	- Dabs remaining until battery dies.
	- Time until battery is charged.
	- Total uptime.
	- Total preheat cycle time.
	- Device birthday.
- [x] Knowing what every bluetooth characteristic does.
- [x] Found hidden features (New device, upcoming features).
- [x] Their staging URL, which actually contained stuff never released.

### Every Single bluetooth characteristic name & offset
The base characteristic UUID is f9a98c15-c651-4f34-b656-d100bf5800
